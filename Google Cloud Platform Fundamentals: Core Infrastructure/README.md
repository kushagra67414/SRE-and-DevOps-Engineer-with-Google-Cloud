# Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

## What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a way of using I.T. that has these five equally important traits. First, you get computing resources on-demand and self-service. All you have to do is use a simple interface and you get the processing power, storage, and network you need, with no need for human intervention. Second, you access these resources over the net from anywhere you want. Third, the provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool. That allows the provider to get economies of scale by buying in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources. Fourth, the resources are elastic. If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less, you can scale back. And last, the customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying. That's it. That's the definition of cloud.

## The Google Network
According to some estimates out there publicly, Google's network carries as much as 40 percent of the world's Internet traffic every day. Google's network is the largest of its kind on earth and the company has invested billions of dollars over the years to build it. It's designed to give its users the highest possible throughput and the lowest possible latencies for their applications. The network interconnects at more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 points of presence worldwide. When an Internet user sends traffic to a Google resource, Google responds to the user's request from an edge network location that will provide the lowest latency. Google's Edge-caching network sites content close to end users to minimize latency.

## Why Choose Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform lets you choose from computing, storage, big data, machine learning and application services for your web, mobile, analytics and back-end solutions. It's global, it's cost effective, it's open source friendly and it's designed for security. Let's sum up. Google Cloud Platform's products and services can be broadly categorized as compute, storage, big data, machine learning, networking and operations and tools. This course considers each of the compute services and discusses why customers might choose each. The course will examine each of Google Cloud Platform storage services, how it works and when customers use it. To learn more about these services, you can participate in the training courses in Google Cloud's Data Analyst learning track. This course also examines the function and purpose of Google Cloud Platform's big data and machine learning services. More details about these services are also available in the training courses in Google Cloud's Data Analyst learning track.
